16-Bit Video Encoding with ffmpeg

Are there any video codecs that support lossless 16-bit RGB compression? In other words, if I have a sequence of PNG images that are RGB 16 bits per channel (48 bits total), and I want to encode them, I should be able to get the exact same PNG sequence, pixel for pixel, when I decode the file. If so, please list all of them that you know of.

If not lossless, are there 16-bit lossy codecs (so that it would produce 16-bit pngs when decoded)?

Yup, ffv1 supports both interleaved rgb48le and planar gbrp16le.

Thanks, I would like to use FFV1. When piping raw frames from my program into a ffmpeg child-process using FFV1 encoder, I get:

    [rawvideo @ 00000052e964dac0] Thread message queue blocking; consider raising the thread_queue_size option (current value: 8)

Does that mean it drops frames when recording the video file to disk?

The reason I'm asking is because ffmpeg is already at high CPU and RAM usage, and if this message means it won't drop frames, I prefer not to raise thread_queue_size, to leave more resources for my parent process (which needs it, because it's generating the frames procedurally).

The command (called by my program) was:

    ffmpeg -loglevel warning -y -f rawvideo -vcodec rawvideo -s 1920x1080 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 24 -i - -i <audio-file> -c:a copy -vf vflip -c:v ffv1 -level 3 -threads 8 -coder 1 -context 1 -g 1 -slices 24 -slicecrc 1 out.mkv

(Also, for some weird reason, VLC shows Frame rate: 24.000384 for this mkv file, even though I specified exactly 24.)

When I use h264 as encoder, I don't get this error. That command was:

    ffmpeg -loglevel warning -y -f rawvideo -vcodec rawvideo -s 1920x1080 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 24 -i - -an -vf vflip -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -force_key_frames expr:gte(tn_forced/2) -bf 2 out.mp4

(My problem with h264 encoding is that I run out of RAM at high resolutions like 8k.)
