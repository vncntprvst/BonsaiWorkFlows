As usual, very annoying issues. 
Sequences will be split by condition, but if saving images, 
then all images even the from the incorrect sequences 
Can save videos, but that's not the goal here, and there will be one video
per frame when the condition is met, that's stupid. 
Need to turn "off" the saving when condition is not met,
and keep it on continuously while the condition is met. 
Using SkipUntil to do that, although I'm no sure that does anything after the 
first (initial) inactive period.
Also, saving only the last 10 frames of each sequence as proxy. 
That describes the reach/grasp pretty well.
